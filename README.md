## About The Project

This Repository contains Server Hardening Techniques which are implemented using Ansible Roles

I have created ansible roles for the following tasks
- accounts : this installs and configures fail2ban which helps in intrusion detection and system administrators can check illegal activities from logs
Also I have created a user ansible which is part of group power which I have given sudo powers

- network : Here we make ssh more secure by only allowing key based login , adding protocol 2 and limiting the number of tries , preventing TcpForwarding and etc
I have also added firewall rules to allow ssh access only from a particular network and only allow webserver access requests and removed all other rules

- physical : This provides security against single user mode and only allows login using password in the grub and also provides security against all types of physical attacks
Also changes grub settings .

-  luks-conf : make a harddisk encrypted for users and users will be able to store data securely and can decrypt it anytime using passphrase

The repository contains ansible vaults
Along with that it contains a role for setting up and configuring docker and kubernetes in remote systems , the role name is kubernetes-docker


### Built With

* [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/)
* [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)
* [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/)


## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.


### Prerequisites

* pip
* AWS ec2 instance


### Installation

1. Install and configure yum, vim and git

2. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ShirshaDatta/Server-Hardening
```

3. Ping to localhost
```sh
ping localhost
```

4. Install Ansible (If python3 not installed, do it and then install ansible )
```sh
pip3 install ansible
or 
yum install ansible

## Usage

Check if ansible is installed successfully. Run the below command.

Setup Firewall Rules.  Run the below given commands.
```
cd Server-Hardening
ansible-playbook network.yml
```

Create Super User and setup fail2ban
```
ansible-playbook --ask-vault-pass accounts.yml
Enter password: $ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASS
```

## Proofs

We saw that the playbook is successfully run. Now we will cross-check the same manually.

Checking if nginx is installed and  the service started and firewall rules.Run the below given commands.
```
systemctl status nginx
iptables -L
```
